## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Angelo, this time I did this challenge with Sass and VanillaJS, I want it to do it on REACT but I'll do it next challenges.

I did use Fetch for the JS petition API, no Async/Await, I feel more confortable working with .then.
for CSS I use Sass just to practice and I love the nested selector and the variables are easier to use on SASS also it has their advantage, anyways It is not necessary to use I used it because I like it.
And FlexBox every where to center Div, Text, and Images, in the process my Mobile Version was kind of struggling with the images, I'm not sure why It has that behaviour when it was on 450px the images just move on other side. I had to use a property RIGHT with 10px to adjust everything on their side. 

So any advices, or anything you want just text me. 
Happy design!
